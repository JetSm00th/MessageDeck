# MessageDeck
Be a nerd that talks good! Get your messages out of your head and onto the table, so you can develop briefs and presentations that get noticed, get remembered, and get results

The MessageDeck is a method for helping technical teams and individuals create alignment around their first-principles messaging, the stuff that makes them unique.

Anyone can deliver a technical presentation, brief, or other content. But if you can support your logic with emotion and credibility, people will be more likely to pay attention.

This version of the MessageDeck Method is being shared to help members of the technical community nail their presentations and become nerds that talk good!

More information about the full MessageDeck Method for companies and commercial applications can be found at HTTP://messagespecs.com/messagedeck.
